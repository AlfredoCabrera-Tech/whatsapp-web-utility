# Installation

The installation process is simple. Since this extension is currently being approved by Google, it has to be installed as an "Unpacked" extension. Here's a step-by-step guide:


1. Go towards the right panel on this site and click on the latest version under "Releases".

2. Select the appropriate "Source code" option.
   - ZIP version if you're using Windows or MacOS.
   - tar.gz version if you're using Linux.

3. After the file has downloaded, decompress the folder (Unzip it), it should create a new -unzipped- folder with the same name as the original file.

4. Open Chrome Browser and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
   
   -  Alternatively, you can click on the Chrome menu, select "More Tools", and then select "Extensions".

5. Toggle the switch to enable "Developer Mode" on the top-right corner.

6. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.

## Alternative way

1. Alternatively, you can go to [This repository's home](https://github.com/AlfredoCabrera-Tech/whatsapp-web-utility) and find the green button that reads "Code" over the top-right corner. Click it.

2. Select the last option on the drop-down menu, the one that reads "Download ZIP".

Continue regular steps 3 - 6 above.
