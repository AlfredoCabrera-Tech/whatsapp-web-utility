# Installation

The installation process is simple. Since this extension is currently being approved by Google, it has to be installed as an "Unpacked" extension. Here's a step-by-step guide:



1. Go to [This repository's home](https://github.com/AlfredoCabrera-Tech/whatsapp-web-utility) and find the green button that reads "Code" over the top-right corner. Click it.

2. Select the last option on the drop-down menu, the one that reads "Download ZIP".

3. After the ZIP file has downloaded, UnZIP the folder, it should create a new -unzipped- folder with the same name as the original file.

4. Open Chrome Browser and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
   
   -  Alternatively, you can click on the Chrome menu, select "More Tools", and then select "Extensions".

5. Toggle the switch to enable "Developer Mode" on the top-right corner.

6. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
